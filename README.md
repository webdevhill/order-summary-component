## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I am pleased with the use of both grid and flex to position elements. Still trying to get my solution to match the provided design pixel perfect. Things look good on my end but it is the total article height in the view port that is not matching. Some of the discrepancies may be caused by different browsers and whether using the device toolbar or manually manipulating the screen size with the Chrome dev tools. I also am trying to speed up my workflow. This is one simple card with four components; image, text with cancel option, plan and CTA button. GitHub, Netlify, screenshots and the README are taking too much time, note to self.
